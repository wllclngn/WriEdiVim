<b>Write & Edit (v3.0): Writing in Vim</b>

VIM EXPERIENCE LEVEL: Novice, Median.

See ".vimrc" for the code to place in "~/.vimrc" file.

<b>NOTE</b>: lightline is not required for functionality of ":WE". However, lightline's ethos works hand-in-hand w/ that of ":WE". For a more informative statusline, it is recommended to install and use lightline w/ ":WE".

See "lightline.vim" for the code to place in "~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/lightline/autoload/lightline.vim" file.

See "documentation.md" for detailed information on what 'Write & Edit (v3.0)...' does.

<b>HISTORY</b>:

I became tired of bloated word processors, and underpowered text-editors were not sufficient. For a long time I sought a text-editor that could handle both computer programming and creative writing environments. Vim was chosen due to its cross-platform, multi-faceted usability, customization, light-weightness and extremely unique editing Modes.

":WE" (v1.0): 12/2016-01/2017<BR>
":WE" (v2.0): 03/2019<BR>
     Removed Format Document function (replaced w/ innoremap functions to automatically acquire proper formatting while typing in a ":WE" environment, see "documentation.md") and removed the WordCount function for the now included wordcount function in VimScript.<BR>
":WE" (v3.0): 06/2021<BR>
     A long overdue release of the incorporation of lightline, automatic formatting updates and bug resolutions.

<b>WARNING</b>: Vim does not promise the functionality of a word processor. While one merely need only copy/paste into a "~/.vimrc" file, the functionality this setup rides on must be understood well.
