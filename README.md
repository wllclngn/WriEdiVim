<b>Write & Edit (v3.0): Writing in Vim</b> 

<b>VIM EXPERIENCE</b>: Novice, Median. 

See ".vimrc" for the code to place in "~/.vimrc" file. 

<b>NOTE</b>: lightline is not required for functionality of ":WE". However,<br
/> lightline's ethos works hand-in-hand w/ that of ":WE". For a more
informative<br /> statusline, it is recommended to install and use lightline w/
":WE". 

See "lightline.vim" for the code to place in<br />
"~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/lightline/autoload/lightline.vim" file. 

See "documentation.md" for detailed information on what 'Write & Edit
(v3.0)...'<br /> does. 

<b>HISTORY</b>: 

I became tired of bloated word processors, and underpowered text-editors were<br
/> not sufficient. For a long time I sought a text-editor that could handle
both<br /> computer programming and creative writing environments. Vim was
chosen due to<br /> its cross-platform, multi-faceted usability, customization,
light-weightness and<br /> extremely unique editing Modes. 

":WE" (v3.0): 06/2021<br /> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long overdue release of the incorporation of <br
/> lightline, automatic formatting updates and bug resolutions.<br /> 

":WE" (v2.0): 03/2019<br /> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removed Format Document function (replaced w/<br
/> innoremap functions to automatically acquire proper formatting while typing
in a<br /> ":WE" environment, see "documentation.md") and removed the WordCount
function<br /> for the now included wordcount function in VimScript.<br /> 

":WE" (v1.0): 12/2016-01/2017 

<b>WARNING</b>: Vim does not promise the functionality of a word processor.<br
/> While one merely need only copy/paste into a "~/.vimrc" file, the
functionality<br /> this setup rides on must be understood well.
