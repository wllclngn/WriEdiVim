<b>Write, Edit, Export (v2.0) in Vim</b>

See ".vimrc" for the code to place in "~/.vimrc" file.

See "documentation.md" for detailed information on what 'Write, Edit, Export' does.

HISTORY: For a long time I sought a text-editor that could handle both computer programming and writing (.txt, .doc, etal) environments. Vim was chosen due to its cross-platform, multi-faceted usability, customization, light-weightness and extremely unique editing Modes that synced hand-in-hand w/ writing just as well as programming. That I was able to create this setup, w/out plugins and w/ minimal code inside of Vim's internal system was another significant bonus. "Write, Edit, Export" took about a month to create (12/2016-01/2017), and culminated in my becoming a novice in Vim. Several updates since its inception to refine the programming and user-exeperience have occured.

VIM EXPERIENCE LEVEL: Novice.

WARNING: Vim does not promise the functionality of a word processor. This setup is for users with advanced/expert knowledge of word processors or text editors when using files for writing. While one merely need only copy/paste into a "~/.vimrc" file, the functionality this setup rides on must be understood well.
