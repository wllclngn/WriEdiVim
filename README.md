<b>Write & Edit (v2.0): Creative writing in Vim</b>

DESCRIPTION: Write & Edit (":WE") was created out of a desire for simplicity when writing creatively. If you feel that bloated software is too much and a notepad-application is not enough, then ":WE" may be the setup for you. ":WE" is a minimal setup, requiring only a "~/.vimrc" file, which any writer can utilize with the user-support and stability of Vim. Written entirely in Vimscript, ":WE" aims for legible code that any user can modify to their liking.

See ".vimrc" for the code to place in "~/.vimrc" file.

See "documentation.md" for detailed information on what 'Write & Edit (v2.0)...' does.

See "WE-Vim.jpeg" for an image of what ":WE" looks like in action.

HISTORY: For a long time I sought a text-editor that could handle both computer programming and creative writing environments. Vim was chosen due to its cross-platform, multi-faceted usability, customization, light-weightness and extremely unique editing Modes that synced hand-in-hand w/ writing creatively just as well as programming. "Write & Edit" (v2.0) took about a month to create (12/2016-01/2017), and has received several updates since its inception to refine the programming and user-exeperience.

VIM EXPERIENCE LEVEL: Novice.

WARNING: Vim does not promise the functionality of a word processor. While one need to know very little of Vim, it is recommended that a user have advanced/expert knowledge of word processors or text editors when using ":WE". While one merely need only copy/paste into a "~/.vimrc" file, the functionality this setup rides on must be understood well.
