<b>Write & Edit (v2.1): Creative writing in Vim</b>

See ".vimrc" for the code to place in "~/.vimrc" file.

See "documentation.md" for detailed information on what 'Write & Edit (v2.1)...' does.

See "WE-Vim.jpeg" for an image of what ":WE" looks like in action.

HISTORY: For a long time I sought a text-editor that could handle both computer programming and creative writing environments. Further, I was tired of bloated word processors, and underpowered text-editors were not sufficient. Vim was chosen due to its cross-platform, multi-faceted usability, customization, light-weightness and extremely unique editing Modes that synced hand-in-hand w/ writing creatively just as well as programming. "Write & Edit" took about a month to create (12/2016-01/2017), and has received several updates since its inception to refine programming and user-exeperience. ":WE" (v2.1) was released in 03/2019 to cut out the unnecessary Format Document function (replaced w/ innoremap functions to automatically acquire proper formatting while typing in a ":WE" environment) and remove WordCount function for the now included wordcount function in VimScript.

VIM EXPERIENCE LEVEL: Novice.

WARNING: Vim does not promise the functionality of a word processor. While one need to know very little of Vim, it is recommended that a user have advanced/expert knowledge of word processors or text editors when using ":WE". While one merely need only copy/paste into a "~/.vimrc" file, the functionality this setup rides on must be understood well.
